The files have been sorted into three folders 
1. Dataset - contains all the datasets used in the scalable fair clustering.
2. 1000_Runs_fixed_size - for sake of parallel execution on HPC & my PC, created copies of same ipython file and computed different datasets 
			  on each file. 
			  So names of file contains the dataset name for which that file has output.

Rest all files have same code for preprocessing, algorithm & post evaluation. Just different datasets are called upon in each.


Requirements :
 
i) Matlab R2021a 
ii) Python 3.8
iii) Jupyter Notebook
